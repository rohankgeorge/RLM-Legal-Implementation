Subject: Regulatory Compliance Update

Dear Board Members,

Following our review of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 12(b) requirements, I am writing to confirm that the company must file its annual compliance report no later than April 30, 2024.

The compliance team has identified EUR 500,000 in potential remediation costs. We recommend allocating these funds from the Q2 operating budget.

Action items:
1. Approve the remediation budget by March 20, 2024
2. Engage external counsel for the SEC filing review
3. Schedule board resolution for April 1, 2024

Please confirm your availability for a special board meeting on March 15, 2024.

Regards,
Jane Smith
