## About RLM

Recursive Language Models (RLM) is a framework that enables language models to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively process contexts of near-infinite length. The RLM library provides core functionality for executing recursive language model operations across various execution environments (local, Docker, Modal, etc.) and supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Portkey, and more).

This tool extends the RLM library with specialized functionality for legal document analysis and query processing, providing both a desktop GUI and command-line interface for working with legal documents.
